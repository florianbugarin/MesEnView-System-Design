%% write_mat_to_tif
% Save a 3D matrix as a multi-page TIFF file without compression.
%
% Parameters:
%   mat (3D array): A 3D matrix where each slice along the third dimension
%                   represents a separate image that will be saved as a 
%                   page in the TIFF file.
%   filename (string): The desired name of the output TIFF file, including 
%                      the file extension (e.g., 'output.tif').
% Function to save a 3D matrix as a multi-page TIFF file without compression.
% 
% Parameters:
%   mat (3D array): A 3D matrix where each slice along the third dimension
%                   represents a separate image that will be saved as a 
%                   page in the TIFF file.
%   filename (string): The desired name of the output TIFF file, including 
%                      the file extension (e.g., 'output.tif').
%
% The function uses the imwrite function to write the images to a TIFF file.
% The first slice of the matrix is written to the file, and subsequent
% slices are appended to create a multi-page TIFF.

function write_mat_to_tif(mat, filename)

    % Save the first slice of the 3D matrix to the specified filename as a TIFF file
    % with no compression.
    imwrite(mat(:,:,1), filename, 'compression', 'none');
    
    % Get the size of the third dimension (number of slices) of the matrix.
    [~, ~, nz] = size(mat);
    
    % Loop through each slice starting from the second slice to the last.
    for i = 2:nz
        % Append each subsequent slice to the TIFF file without compression.
        imwrite(mat(:,:,i), filename, 'compression', 'none', 'writemode', 'append'); 
    end
