%% bg_removal
% This function performs background removal from an input image using
% morphological opening. It computes the background and then subtracts it
% from the original image to enhance the foreground features.
%
% @param image A grayscale or binary image from which the background is to be removed.
%              The input image is expected to be a 2D matrix.
% @param kernel_size A scalar value that defines the size of the structuring element
%                    (disk shape) used in the morphological operation. It controls the
%                    degree of background smoothing; larger values result in more
%                    aggressive background removal.
% @return img The resulting image after background subtraction. This image
%             highlights the foreground objects by removing the estimated
%             background.
% @return bg The estimated background image obtained using morphological opening.
%             This image represents the smoothed version of the original image.
function [img,bg] = bg_removal(image, kernel_size)
% bg_removal - This function performs background removal from an input image
% using morphological opening. It computes the background and then subtracts
% it from the original image to enhance the foreground features.
%
% Syntax: [img, bg] = bg_removal(image, kernel_size)
%
% Inputs:
%   image      - A grayscale or binary image from which the background is to be removed.
%                The input image is expected to be a 2D matrix.
%   kernel_size - A scalar value that defines the size of the structuring element
%                (disk shape) used in the morphological operation. It controls the
%                degree of background smoothing; larger values result in more
%                aggressive background removal.
%
% Outputs:
%   img        - The resulting image after background subtraction. This image
%                highlights the foreground objects by removing the estimated
%                background.
%   bg         - The estimated background image obtained using morphological opening.
%                This image represents the smoothed version of the original image.
%
% Example: 
%   [foreground, background] = bg_removal(input_image, 5);

% Perform morphological opening on the input image using a disk-shaped structuring element.
% The structuring element has a radius defined by kernel_size.
bg = imopen(image, strel('disk', kernel_size, 8));

% Subtract the estimated background from the original image to obtain the foreground.
img = imsubtract(image, bg);
