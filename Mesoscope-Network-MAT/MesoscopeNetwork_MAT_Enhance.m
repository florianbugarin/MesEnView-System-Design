%% enhance_contrast_high_mat
% Enhances the contrast of an input matrix by clipping high intensity values.
%
% Syntax:
%   [output, val_max] = enhance_contrast_high_mat(data, high_threshold)
%
% Inputs:
%   data (numeric matrix or array): The original intensity values to be processed.
%   high_threshold (scalar, optional): The cumulative distribution function (CDF) threshold for clipping high intensity values. Defaults to 0.9999 if not provided.
%
% Outputs:
%   output (numeric matrix): The modified matrix with high intensity values clipped to enhance contrast.
%   val_max (scalar): The maximum intensity level that was clipped during the enhancement process.
function [output, val_max] = enhance_contrast_high_mat(data, high_threshold)
% enhance_contrast_high_mat - Enhances the contrast of an input matrix by clipping high intensity values.
%
% Syntax: [output, val_max] = enhance_contrast_high_mat(data, high_threshold)
%
% Inputs:
%   data - A numeric matrix or array containing the original intensity values, which will be processed 
%          to enhance contrast. The data is converted to double precision for accurate calculations.
%   high_threshold - A scalar value representing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) threshold 
%                    for clipping high intensity values. If not provided, defaults to 0.9999.
%
% Outputs:
%   output - A numeric matrix of the same size as the input 'data', where high intensity values have 
%            been clipped to enhance contrast.
%   val_max - A scalar value representing the maximum intensity level that was clipped during the 
%             enhancement process.

% Convert the input data to double precision for accurate calculations
data = double(data);

% Check if only one input argument was provided; if so, set the default high threshold
if nargin == 1
    high_threshold = 0.9999; % Default threshold for high intensity clipping
end

% Create a histogram of the flattened data with a specified number of bins (2^14)
hist_obj = histogram(data(:), 2^14);

% Extract the edges and counts of the histogram bins
bin_edges = hist_obj.BinEdges; % The edges of the histogram bins
bin_counts = hist_obj.BinCounts; % The counts of pixels in each bin

% Calculate the probability density function (PDF) from the bin counts
pdf = bin_counts ./ sum(bin_counts(:)); 

% Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) from the PDF
cdf = cumsum(pdf); 

% Find the index of the bin where the CDF is closest to the high threshold
[~, idx] = min(abs(cdf - high_threshold));

% Calculate the high clipping value as the average of the bin edge at the found index and the next one
high_clip_val = 0.5 * (bin_edges(idx) + bin_edges(idx + 1));

% Clip the data values that are greater than or equal to the high clipping value
data(data >= high_clip_val) = high_clip_val;

% Store the high clipping value to output
val_max = high_clip_val; 

% Set the output to the modified data
output = data; 

% Close all histogram figures (if any were opened)
close all;
