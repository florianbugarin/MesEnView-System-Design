"""
This script combines existing ground truths for beads and synthetic vasculature into a single composite ground truth.

The script reads the bead and vasculature ground truth TIFF files, combines them with a weighting factor, normalizes the result linearly, and writes the composite ground truth to a new TIFF file in the output path.

The script is intended to be a temporary solution until the synthetic data generation is migrated to the sbrnet-core package.
