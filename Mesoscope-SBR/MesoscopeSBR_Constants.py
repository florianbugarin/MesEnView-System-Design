This module defines various constants used throughout the SBRNet project.

The constants include:
- `CM2_SIZE`: The size of the camera matrix in pixels.
- `NUM_VIEWS`: The number of camera views (angles) to be used.
- `FOCUS_LOC`: An array of focal locations (in pixels) for each view.
- `NUM_SLICES`: The number of slices in the refocus volume.
- `view_combos`: A list of combinations of views to be used for rendering/refocusing.
