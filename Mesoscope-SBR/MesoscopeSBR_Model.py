"""
The SBRNet class is a neural network model that implements a specific architecture using ResNet as the backbone. It consists of two main branches: the view synthesis branch and the refinement branch. The model takes two input tensors, the low-frequency view stack (lf_view_stack) and the refinement view (rfv), and produces an output tensor.

The ResConnection class implements a residual connection with scaling, where the input tensor is added to the output of the sequential layers, and the result is scaled by a constant factor (RSQRT2).

The ResBlock class defines a single residual block, which consists of two convolutional layers with batch normalization.

The ResNetCM2NetBlock class is a sequential model block based on the ResNet architecture. It is initialized based on the specified branch (either 'view_synthesis' or 'refinement') and the configuration dictionary.
