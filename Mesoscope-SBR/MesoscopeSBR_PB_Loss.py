"""
Implements the Pinball Loss, which is commonly used in quantile regression tasks.

The `PinballLoss` class calculates the Pinball Loss between the predicted output and the target values. The Pinball Loss is a piecewise linear function that penalizes predictions above and below the target value differently, based on the specified quantile level.

Args:
    quantile (float): The quantile level for the loss, should be in the range (0, 1). It defines the quantile to be estimated; for instance, 0.10 corresponds to the 10th percentile.
    reduction (str): Specifies the reduction method to apply to the output. Options are "none" (no reduction), "mean" (average of losses), and "sum" (sum of losses).

Returns:
    torch.Tensor: The computed loss value, reduced according to the specified method.
