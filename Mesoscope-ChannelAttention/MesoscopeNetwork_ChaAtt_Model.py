"""
Implements the Residual Channel Attention Network (RCAN) for image restoration.

The RCAN model consists of several key components:
- ChannelAttention: Applies channel attention mechanism to enhance feature representations.
- RCAB: Residual Channel Attention Block that combines convolution, ReLU, and channel attention.
- RG: Residual Group that contains multiple RCABs followed by a convolution layer.
- RCAN: The main RCAN model that applies downscaling, residual groups, upscaling, and final convolution.
- FourierDeconvolution2D_ds: Performs deconvolution in the frequency domain for each point spread function (PSF).
- MultiWienerDeconvolution2D: Applies Wiener deconvolution in the frequency domain for each PSF.
- LSVEnsemble2d: Combines the deconvolution and enhancement models into an ensemble.
- resblock: Residual block for building deeper networks with skip connections.
- cm2netblock: A neural network block that consists of convolutional layers and residual blocks.
- cm2net: The main network class that combines the demixing and reconstruction blocks.

The documentation provides an overview of the key components and their functionality within the RCAN model.

The code defines several neural network models and their components for image restoration tasks. A brief overview of each module:

1. **RCAB (Residual Channel Attention Block)**: This module is designed for image restoration tasks. It includes a convolution layer, a channel attention layer, and a residual connection. The channel attention layer helps in adjusting the channel-wise feature responses adaptively.

2. **RG (Residual Group)**: This module consists of multiple RCABs followed by a convolution layer. It is used to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network.

3. **FourierDeconvolution2D**: This module performs Wiener deconvolution in the frequency domain for each PSF. It includes a first convolution, a list of residual blocks, and a second convolution.

4. **LSVEnsemble2D**: This is an ensemble model that combines deconvolution and enhancement processes. It consists of two cm2netblocks for demixing and reconstruction, followed by a final convolutional layer and a sigmoid activation function.

5. **cm2netblock**: This module is a neural network block that includes a first convolution, a list of residual blocks, and a second convolution. It is used in the LSVEnsemble2D model for demixing and reconstruction.

6. **cm2net**: This is the main network class that consists of two cm2netblocks for demixing and reconstruction, followed by a final convolutional layer and a sigmoid activation function.
